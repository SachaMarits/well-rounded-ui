## About Well Rounded

Compact yet powerful package meaning you won't have to spend many hours to understand how simple it is to use !

### Reusable Components

Many reusable components:
* Buttons with predefined styles
* Inputs fields: All types are supported (text, textarea, date, select, checkboxes, etc)
* Easy editable Spinners
* Smooth Alerts like sweet-alert package
* MultiSelect to select several entries
* Modal to show more data over the page
* Floating side bar for in depth information
* Tabs to split your contents
* Badges to highlight important texts
* Customizable Table provided with a Pagination component ! 
* And more to discover...

### Homemade components

This package does not use bootstrap, sweet alert, multi-select, reactstrap and more but they are still available: reasons why?

I build my own bootstrap* column layout, buttons components, multi-select, sweet alert, ... <br />
It avoids the project to import useless css and packages prefering focusing the usefull features only.

*Many class names from bootstrap exist with the same name so you won't be lost ! 

### Material Design Icons

Free to use popular icons with many new icons being added monthly. <br />
I have been using this icon library for many years always finding the perfect icon to use.
